## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize


### 1\. Change the Student List

The list of names is stored in a simple JavaScript array.

  * Open the file `src/data.js`.

  * Modify the `juniorNames` array with the names you want to generate certificates for.

    ```javascript
    export const juniorNames = [
      'NEW STUDENT NAME 1',
      'NEW STUDENT NAME 2',
      // ...add as many names as you need
    ];
    ```

### 2\. Update Certificate Text and Details

All the text on the certificate can be modified in the following component files:

  * **Main Text (`Template.jsx`)**: To change the course title, description, or date, edit the `src/Component/Template.jsx` file.
  * **Header (`header.jsx`)**: To change the institution names or logos, edit `src/Component/header.jsx`.
  * **Footer (`footer.jsx`)**: To change the signature names and titles, edit `src/Component/footer.jsx`.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Update `vite.config.js`**:

      * Make sure the `base` property in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name. For example, if your repository is named `my-certificate-app`, the config should be:
        ```javascript
        export default defineConfig({
          plugins: [react()],
          base: '/my-certificate-app/',
        })
        ```

2.  **Run the Deploy Script**:

      * Once your changes are committed and pushed to the `main` branch, simply run:
        ```bash
        npm run deploy
        ```
      * This will build your project and push it to the `gh-pages` branch.

3.  **Configure GitHub Pages**:

      * In your GitHub repository settings, go to **Pages**.
      * Set the **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
      * Select **`gh-pages`** as the branch and `/root` as the folder.
      * Save the changes, and your site will be live in a few minutes\!
